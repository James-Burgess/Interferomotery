    "# Designing an Interferometer Array\n",
    "\n",
    "In this group project, your team will be designing a radio antenna array (an interferometer). You\n",
    "will need to balance a variety of technical and scientific constraints, and you will use a variety\n",
    "of tools to _design_ candidate arrays, _simulate_ the operation and _quantify_ the performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your telescope will be built to conduct a single survey for its operational lifetime, and the target\n",
    "sensitivity of your survey is $\\sigma_\\mathrm{survey}=10\\mu\\,\\mathrm{Jy}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "An ideal radio interferometer measures the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution from an\n",
    "astronomical source. In practice, the convolution of the telescope's sampling function _and_ the\n",
    "source's brightness distribution is measured. Image reconstruction is the process of _undoing_ this\n",
    "convolution (or the Fourier multiplication), and is often referred to as deconvolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The telescope's sampling function plays a central role in image reconstruction -- you need as many\n",
    "independent measurements as possible to reconstruct an image, but redundant measurements also help\n",
    "with calibrating a radio telescope.  The resolution of your telescope is determined by the longest\n",
    "baseline, so the longer the baseline, the better the resolution. You will find, however, that having\n",
    "a single (or a few) long baselines is not sufficient to ensure good resolution -- you need many long\n",
    "baselines, and you need many _intermediate_ baselines to provide good sampling of the Fourier\n",
    "domain.  Finally, while higher resolution is a _good_ thing, you need short baselines to observe\n",
    "extended sources (e.g., gas around nearby galaxies). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the design of a radio array is a fine balance between resolution and sensitivity.\n",
    "Resolution motivates for long baseline, and sensitivity motivates for more antennas. \n",

    "## Constraints\n",
    "Your team has a budget of 200,000,000 credits (CR) to design an optimal antenna layout, and a\n",
    "daily operational budget of 2,000,000CR. That is, once you have constructed your telescope, you will\n",
    "have 2M-CR/day to operate your telescope. The following constraints apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have 5-years to build and operation your telescope.\n",
    "* Each dish costs 100,000CR to build.\n",
    "* You will need some cable and infrastructure for each dish. For each dish, this infrastructural\n",
    "  cost is 1000CR per metre away from the centre of the array. For example, the infrastructural cost\n",
    "  for a dish that is 3200-_metres_ away from the centre of the array is 3,200,000CR.\n",
    "* The maximum baseline cannot exceed 20km.\n",
    "* The dish size is 12-metres. Therefore, the minimum distance between each dish is 12-metres. In\n",
    "  practice, the real distance is slightly larger to avoid _shadowing_.\n",
    "* Deduce/invent a way to measure _how well_ your radio array has reconstructed the test image, which\n",
    "  is a measure of image _fidelity_. For example, the difference between the output image (i.e.,\n",
    "  after imaging) and your original test image ought to be as small as possible. Another possible\n",
    "  metric could be the ratio of the test and output images; perfect reconstruction would produce a\n",
    "  ratio-image that is unity everywhere. In practice, neither metric will be perfect. There is,\n",
    "  however, a task in CASA that will do an evaluation for you, and will calculate a fidelity image\n",
    "  for you. Consult the guide on [simulating observations][casasim] for more details and ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplementary Material\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided a [Jupyter Notebook][support] that contains information and supplementary material for the\n",
    "following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operational costs: The daily operational costs of a telescope are not constant as a function of\n",
    "  time. In your project I have included a very simple relation on how the operational costs scale as\n",
    "  a function of time. \n",
    "* Which $T_\\mathrm{sys}$ value to use for your array, based on how many antennas you end up\n",
    "  building. Providing cryogenic cooling for a large dish array is expensive business. While you can\n",
    "  achieve a desirably low system temperature for a modest number of dishes, you will soon run out of\n",
    "  funding if you start cooling a large number of dishes. Therefore, while it may be a good idea to\n",
    "  build a huge numbr of dishes, you may not be able to cool them sufficiently to achieve a good\n",
    "  sensitivity.\n",
    "* Antenna efficiency as a function of build time. The build time for a dish varies from 0.5-2 days,\n",
    "  with a 12-hour build time yielding antennas with the lowest efficiency, and a 2-day build time\n",
    "  producing dishes with a 100% efficiency. This is a soft limit on the number of dishes that you can\n",
    "  produce.\n",
    "* How to calculate the sensitivity of your telescope for a given $T_\\mathrm{sys}$ using the\n",
    "  radiometer equation. \n",
    "  * You will not be able to simulate the full observations of your survey (e.g., thousands of\n",
    "    hours), neither will it be feasible to create a suitably deep mock image (e.g., thousands of\n",
    "    sources). Your simulation will be of a single day's worth of observations. Depending on your\n",
    "    design and your parameters, you can calculate the sensitivity of your telescope, and therefore\n",

    "## Science and Sensitivity\n",
    "Your telescope will be built to conduct a single large radio survey. You will need to finish this\n",
    "survey before the end of the 5-year lifetime of your telescope. The target sensitivity of this\n",
    "survey is $\\sigma_\\mathrm{survey}=10\\mu\\,\\mathrm{Jy}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are only observing a single channel, the sensitivity of your radio telescope is given by\n",
    "the simple equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_\\mathrm{survey} = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{\\sqrt{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T_\\mathrm{sys}}{(N(N-1)\\tau\\nu)^\\frac{1}{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the efficiency of your telescope, $\\nu=10\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ is the bandwidth of\n",
    "your single channel, and $k_\\mathrm{B}=1.38\\times10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Jy\\,K^{-1}}{}$ is the scaled\n",
    "Boltzmann constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of your telescope is to achieve the target sensitivity. You will need to balance the system\n",
    "temperature, number of dishes, efficiency and total observational time to achieve this target\n",
    "sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_\\mathrm{survey}$ is a measure of the faintest source that you can measure with any degree\n",
    "of confidence with your radio telescope. In practice, a multiple of this value is used as the\n",
    "threshold for source identification, e.g., a $3\\sigma_\\mathrm{survey}$ source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below I illustrate the typical sensitivity as a function of time, for an array of 500-dishes, \n",
    "assuming perfect efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you need to state the time taken for your array to reach the target sensitivity, and\n",
