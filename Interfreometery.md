# Interfreometery 
## Discovering the optimal placement of radio telescopes
### Constraints
- Budget
- Resolution
- Sensitivty
- Time
- Calibration (more is more)

### Equations
- The number of baselines (nb) for an array of n telescopes is given by nb=(n2- n)/2. 
- The resolution(R) of an Interferometer is given by R=L/B (Resolution = lambda / longest baseline)
- Sensitivity Lowered by the beam dilution factor ~(L/D)^2 

### Todo 
- [ ] create array models according to constarints
- [ ] judgde arrays according to their plane coverage [Aperature Synthesis Genorator Code](https://launchpad.net/apsynsim)
- [ ] Tabulate results and review to find patterns
- [ ] Reiterate With new knowledge of high fidelity patterens
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
